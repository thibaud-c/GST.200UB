    "\n",
    "1. For each point, count how many neighbours it has within distance `eps`.  \n",
    "2. If it has at least `min_samples` neighbours, it is a **core point**.  \n",
    "3. Clusters are formed by connecting core points and their nearby neighbours.  \n",
    "4. Points that are not part of any cluster are labelled as **noise** (`-1`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Why DBSCAN is useful for crime analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It discovers clusters of **arbitrary shape** (not just circular).  \n",
    "- It can identify **noise** (isolated incidents).  \n",
    "- You do not need to choose the **number of clusters** in advance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Results are sensitive to the choice of `eps` and `min_samples`.  \n",
    "- A single pair of parameters may not work well across all areas (dense city centre vs sparse suburbs)."
