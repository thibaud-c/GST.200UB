    "\n",
    "🚀 **Tasks:**\n",
    "1. Calculate the area of each of the buffer\n",
    "2. Calculate the ring areas by differences of cumulative areas (e.g. A500 − A250). \n",
    "3. Calculate the area not fitting within the buffer (`outside_area`)\n",
    "4. Do a weighted average of the rings (multiply each ring’s area by its mid-point distance), don't forget to add the `outside_area`\n",
    "5. (Optional 🥊) Per-cell version: Instead of a single city number, overlay the rings with a 1 km² grid and compute the same area-weighted average per cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "💡 **Information:**\n",
    "- Using ring mid-points reduces the upward bias you’d get from weighting by the upper edge of each band.\n",
    "- Pick a plausible representative value for areas beyond your largest radius: `outside_area` \n"
